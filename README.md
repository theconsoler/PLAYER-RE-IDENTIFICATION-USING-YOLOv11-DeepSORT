# PLAYER-RE-IDENTIFICATION-USING-YOLOv11-DeepSORT
This project implements a real-time football player tracking system using YOLOv11 (Ultralytics) for object detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking. Each player is assigned a unique, consistent ID across video frames, ensuring accurate re-identification even during occlusions or rapid movement.
